  "paragraph": "As a Computer Engineering student specializing in Fullstack Development, I am passionate about creating web applications that are not only functional but also scalable and user-friendly. I have technical expertise in modern stacks, including React, Node.js, and Laravel. I have applied these skills to real-world projects, such as designing and building a community platform for Indonesian film enthusiasts. In this project, I implemented MVC and Repository Pattern architectures to ensure clean and maintainable code, and handled the deployment independently via cPanel. Beyond web development, I am actively exploring Machine Learning with Python to solve practical problems, such as building a keyword prediction model for scientific articles."
